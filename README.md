# LinearVariableStiffnessHoneycomb
This repository contains files of different types and extensions related to my project "Linear Negative Stiffness Honeycomb Actuator with Integrated Force Sensing".

This code was designed and tested in Microsoft Visual Studio.

The "Source.cpp" file is an example of a working code. All the other variations of the codes are presented in the "Scripts" folder.
They are presented in txt format so you will only need to copy-paste them to your source code. 

Also it is very important to properly install the Dynamixel and Daq libraries for C.

The "ForceSensor.zip" file contains schematic project of designed PCB to acquire data from the CGQ-MH Load Cell.
The "PCB_Magnet_sensor_linear.zip" file contains the schematic project of designed PCB to acquire data from magnetic sensor AD22151, Analog Devices.
All PCB schematic projects were made in Altium Designer software.

The "PrintedParts.zip" file contains .cad/.stl files of all parts and details involved in project. All the files were designed in SolidWorks software and printed with Ultimaker 3D printer using polylactide (PLA) material.

For Dynamixel library this link will be useful: http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/dynamixel/dynamixel_sdk/library_setup/c_windows/#c-windows

For using NI-DAQ in different softwares NIDAQMX will be usefull:
