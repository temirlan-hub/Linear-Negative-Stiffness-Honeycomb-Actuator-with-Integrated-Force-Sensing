# LinearVariableStiffnessHoneycomb
This repository contains files od different types and extensions related to my project "Linear Negative Stiffness Honeycomb Actuator with Integrated Force Sensing".

This code was designed and tested in Microsoft Visual Studio.

The "Source.cpp" file is an example of a working code. All the other variations of the codesare presented in the "Scripts" file.
They are presented in txt format so you will only need to copy-paste them to your source code. 

Also it is very important to properly install the Dynamixel and Daq libraries for C.

For Dynamixel library this link will be useful: http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/dynamixel/dynamixel_sdk/library_setup/c_windows/#c-windows

For using NI-DAQ in different softwares NIDAQMX will be usefull:
